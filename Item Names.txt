Using the default modern script features, items that will be useable will have the their tag used as their script name.
Eg. recall gem with tag "IT_RecallGem" would have to have a script named "it_recallgem" (all lower case) to run the on activated script features.
The script names need to be 16 characters max, so I need to come up with a good tagging system so the scripts can be named well.
A prefix is good for keeping them ordered, but takes up space. Might be able to keep "IT" with no underscore, or "I*" with symbol for type.

All items will need to have a 16 character maximum tag name if they will be useable. Normally tags can be 32 characters.
Might need to drop the "u8" prefix just to save space and allow better description.
A list of all items might make this easier to deicde on though.

ITRecallGem     |
ITSkullOfQuakes |  // Not sure if this will need to be useable. It might just be something to put in an altar to earthquake and open the door.
ITMorphShape    |  // The morphing shape item in Mythrans house. Old EAC logo. On use it bows and says message.
ITKeyCaretaker  |  // Necromancer wand/rod thing. It needs to be useable to craft Earth spells. A special tagged bag will be used for mixing. For auto open tagged doors, these might need to share tag/script?

ITKeyBlank      |  // The mystery blank key hidden behind wall of Tenebrae palace. It might need to be a useable action item to unlock doors with different tag.
