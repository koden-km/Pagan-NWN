Using the default modern script features, items that will be useable will have the their tag used as their script name.
Eg. recal gem with tag "IT_RecallGem" would have to have a script named "it_recallgem" (all lower case) to run the on activated script features.
The script names need to be 16 characters max, so I need to come up with a good tagging system so the scripts can be named well.

All items will need to have a 16 character maximum tag name if they will be useable. Normally tags can be 32 characters.
Might need to drop the "u8" prefix just to save space and allow better description.
A list of all items might make this easier to deicde on though.
