Gameplay Goals For Remake
-------------------------

Standard NWN character classes and leveling. This might help it feel more like the older Ultima's where you had classes, even U9.

Aiming for play through of U8 story. Including learning the spells of Pagan. 



Things to figure out and/or confirm before getting in to deep
-------------------------------------------------------------

* Can NPCs waypoint through area transitions?

* If i need an NPC from other areas for cut scenes or locations during time schedule should I:
  teleport them, walk them, or spawn a clone? (depends on above if NPCs can transition).

* Tag names are limited to 32 characters?



Tutorials

Debugging
---------
https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=Category:Debug_Functions



Debug Message Helper
--------------------
https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=PrintString
https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=WriteTimestampedLogEntry

Records a message to the log file.

void PrintString(
    string sString
);

// sample debug call, covers many testing bases:
void debug(string sMessage) 
{
     SendMessageToPC(GetFirstPC(), sMessage);
     SendMessageToAllDMs(sMessage);
     PrintString(sMessage);
}

Records a string in the log file along with a date-time stamp.

void WriteTimestampedLogEntry(
    string sLogEntry
);

Example:

// This call would produce "[Fri Jul 12 12:08:03] Test" in the log file
WriteTimestampedLogEntry("Test");



Debug Logic Helper (runscript)
------------------------------

KM: Apparently there is some kind of console mode and you can run custom scripts?
Mentioned here: https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=An_Introduction_To_Tile_Magic
"Start your module, enter the area, enable debugmode, and run your script using the runscript command."

This will allow me to build in some plot skipper tools to jump ahead in the plot and test things better.
One of the main things to skip would be the docks scene so that the chracters are all in place for the regular game.



Constants
---------

Constants can be defined in an include file. This will make working with things like tags much nicer in many files.
Each file can just import the/a constant definition file.
Constants can be: int, float, string.

// KM: The constant makes it strict, the string value can be what ever, but may as well match. Length limit 32 characters?
const string U8_IT_THING = "U8_IT_THING";

Cut Scene Tutorial
------------------
https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=Category:Cut_Scenes

KM: Hmm they might be old now though? The first tutorial in that series says this:
"Note: these tutorials were written prior to the new cut-scene functionality added by BioWare in patch 1.30."



Cut Scene NPC Control
---------------------
https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=ActionMoveToLocation

void ActionMoveToLocation(
    location locDestination,
    int bRun = FALSE
);

KM: I will probably want to also disable regular AI so they only act as told.
I think i saw some functions related to AI that might help with that. Paralyze isn't going to work for this or I can't move them.

// Make the calling object walk to a waypoint
void main()
{
     object oWP = GetObjectByTag("my_waypoint");
     location lDestination = GetLocation(oWP);
     ActionMoveToLocation(lDestination,FALSE);
}

Also see this one:
https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=MoveToNewLocation

void MoveToNewLocation(
    location lNewLocation = none,
    object oTarget = OBJECT_SELF
);

This is a convenience function that places two commands in the target objects queue using two AssignCommand calls. The first wraps 
ActionMoveToLocation(lNewLocation, FALSE). 
The second wraps 
ActionDoCommand(SetFacing(GetFacingFromLocation(lNewLocation)) 
These two commands effectively command the target to move to the new location, then instructs the target to face the correct way once they get there.
The default target is OBJECT_SELF. Note that the restrictions to AssignCommand, ActionMoveToLocation, and SetFacing still apply. 



Cut Scene Creature Paralyze (mainly the Player)
-----------------------------------------------
https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=EffectCutsceneParalyze

Returns an effect that is guranteed to paralyze a creature; this effect is identical to EffectParalyze except that it cannot be resisted.

See notes for EffectParalyze for more remarks, code and description.

The target this effect is applied to must be a creature for it to work. This effect should not be applied instantly, only temporarily or permanently.

KM: Need this for cut scenes like the docks where the player can watch but not interact.

effect EffectCutsceneParalyze();



Coloured Text
-------------
https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=StringToRGBString

string StringToRGBString(
    string sString,
    string sRGB
);

...
string sNewItemName = "Sir Elric's Bulletproof Plate Mail";
SetName(oItem, StringToRGBString(sNewItemName, STRING_COLOR_RED));

if(GetName(oItem) == "Sir Elric's Bulletproof Plate Mail")
{ // this will never happen
}
else if(GetName(oItem) == sNewItemName)
{ // this will never happen either
}
else
{ // this will always happen
}

if(GetName(oItem) == StringToRGBString(sNewItemName, STRING_COLOR_RED))
{ // this will always happen
}
...



Guardian Taunts
---------------

Should be able to do these by making the Player or some hidden entity yell some text when the player crosses a trigger.
The trigger should fire once only when certain plot progress is reached.
Not sure if a yell appears above a head, if so i guess do it on the Player (as per U9 plot). Pretty sure yell text is red also.


Stone of Recall (from Mythran)
------------------------------
http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Stone_of_recall_system

KM: This is like the one in the official NWN game, but with some changes this can work like U8.
KM: Not sure why these script snippets from the tutorials have extra braces. It should be easy to clean when ready to import.

Create your item. Be sure to give it a unique tag name and that you remember that tagname.
Make it "magical". Edit the properties of the item and click the "Properties" tab.
There, you should see a whole bunch of effects. Go down to "Cast Spell" and click that to open that, then go down to "Unique Power".
Decide if it's a power that you will cast on others, or only on the wielder, then double-click the appropriate decision.
When you double-clicked, that added that Unique Power to the right-hand pane of the window. Double-click the power there, to determine how many charges per day it gets.
When done, click OK/Done to get back to the editor.
Now you have your item, you need to get it to work. Here's what you do:

Go to Edit->Module Properties->Events
For the OnActivateItem click Edit.
Paste this script and save as "StoneRecall01" (or whatever you want)

void main()
{
	object oActivated = GetItemActivated();
	switch (2);
	{
		// Item 1 = Stone of Recall type item.
		case 1:
			if (GetTag(oActivated) == "item1")
			{
				object oObject = GetItemActivator();
				object oTarget = GetItemActivator();
				location lLocation = GetLocation(oObject);
				{
					// Object 1 = A Placeable object (invisible object works best). Must be the blueprint name NOT TAG!!
					CreateObject(OBJECT_TYPE_PLACEABLE, "object1", lLocation, FALSE);
				}
				{
					// stonerecall02 = name of second script
					ExecuteScript("stonerecall02", oTarget);
				}
			}
			break;
	}
}

Create a new placeable object and give it a unique tag. Make sure its appearance is set to Invisible Object. This is your object1 in the script above.
Create a new waypoint and give it a unique name. Place this where you want the player to appear after activating the item.
Go to the Script Editor, paste this in and save as "stonerecall02".

void main()
{
	object oActivated = GetItemActivated();
	switch (2);
	{
		case 1:
			if (GetTag(oActivated) == "item1")
			{
				object oPC = GetItemActivator();
				// waypoint1 = Tag of waypoint where the player will be taken to when they activate the stone
				object oTarget = GetWaypointByTag("waypoint1");
				AssignCommand(oPC,JumpToObject(oTarget));
				ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_INSTANT, EffectVisualEffect (VFX_IMP_HOLY_AID), oPC);
			}
			break;
	}
}

Create a Recall Portal near the waypoint you just made.
Go to the Advanced Tab and edit the conversation.
Create a new conversation, with just a simple line like "This will take you back to where you activated the Stone of Recall".
Add a PC line such as "Step in to the Portal" and then add this script to the Actions Taken part.

void main()
{
	location lLocation;
	object oObject, oActionSubject, oPC, oDestroy;
	{
		// object1 = TAG name of the placeable created in the first script	
		oObject = GetObjectByTag("object1", 0);
		oDestroy = GetObjectByTag("object1", 0);
		oActionSubject = GetPCSpeaker();
		oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
		lLocation = GetLocation(oObject);
		{
			AssignCommand(oActionSubject, ActionJumpToLocation(lLocation));
			ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_INSTANT, EffectVisualEffect (VFX_IMP_UNSUMMON), oPC);
		}
		{
			DestroyObject(oDestroy, 3.0);
		}
	}
}



NPC Door closing
----------------
https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=AnimActionCloseRandomDoor

Causes an NPC to close a nearby open door.

KM: The NPC's used to close their house doors every so often if left open. "Who left this open?"

int AnimActionCloseRandomDoor();



NPC Schedules
-------------
https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=Category:Animation_Functions

KM: Not sure how to handle time of day. U8 had some custom hour period things, i think 6 total?
I need to prevent day from happening to keep the twilight theme of Pagan.
I could try run the clock as normal but only over a 6 hour range and reset it to the start range each time?

KM: Sounds like awesome stuff! :D

AnimActionGoHome
AnimActionLeaveHome
AnimActionSitInChair
AnimActionGetUpFromChair

Waypoints for schedules?
This talks about some automatic waypoint helper function: https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=CheckWayPoints
This function takes oWalker's tag, and looks for waypoint tags with matching names: "POST_<tag>" and "WP_<tag>_01" (always checked).
If the NW_FLAG_DAY_NIGHT_POSTING spawn-in condition has been set in oWalker's OnSpawn script, then "NIGHT_<tag>" and "WN_<tag>" are also sought.
The NPC can have multiples of the WP_ and WN_ waypoints, but only one POST_ and one NIGHT_ waypoint.
KM: I guess i could build something similar for the Pagan time system that works generic based on tag concat for each NPC.

// Source for CheckWayPoints():
int CheckWayPoints(object oWalker = OBJECT_SELF)
{
    object oWay1;
    object oWay2;
    object oWay3;
    object oWay4;
    string sTag = GetTag(oWalker);
    if(GetSpawnInCondition(NW_FLAG_DAY_NIGHT_POSTING))
    {
        oWay2 = GetWaypointByTag("NIGHT_" + sTag);
        oWay4 = GetWaypointByTag("WN_" + sTag + "_01");
    }
 
    oWay1 = GetWaypointByTag("POST_" + sTag);
    oWay3 = GetWaypointByTag("WP_" + sTag + "_01");
 
    if(GetIsObjectValid(oWay2) || GetIsObjectValid(oWay4) || GetIsObjectValid(oWay1) || GetIsObjectValid(oWay3))
    {
        return TRUE;
    }
    return FALSE;
}



City Guards
-----------
https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=WalkWayPoints

void WalkWayPoints(
    int nRun = FALSE,
    float fPause = 1.0
);

The waypoints to walk must have tags in the format "WP_" + NPC's tag name + "_0#".
Example: WP_CITYGUARD_01. The # determines what order the NPC walks the waypoints in.
You may also have up to one "POST_" + NPC's tag name waypoint tagged; if so the NPC will return to this waypoint after a combat.
Waypoint names are case-sensitive.

KM: They should do their waypoint walk patrol with pause or their stand guard and comment.
Comments like "Watch for undead." and "Boy this weapon gets heavy!" (with weapon animation).



Weather
-------
https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=SetWeather

Allows you to set the weather for an area or the entire module.

void SetWeather(
    object oTarget,
    int nWeather
);

KM: When Hydros is free, this will cause all outdoor areas to rain non stop:
KM: Fog can be set also i think. I remember there being fog after Hydros free.

SetWeather(GetModule(), WEATHER_RAIN);



Change Ground Tiles (Tile Magic)
--------------------------------
https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=TLChangeAreaGroundTiles
https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=An_Introduction_To_Tile_Magic

This function will flood the entire area with the tile in question. nColumns and nRows indicate the size of the area. For instance, a 4 * 6 area will have 4 columns and 6 rows.

You may not want to flood your entire area, but this function will give you a pretty good idea how to use the tile magic (tm). Basically, you just create an invisible object in the center of a tile, and apply a permanent visual effect to that invisible object.

void TLChangeAreaGroundTiles(
    object oArea,
    int nGroundTileConst,
    int nColumns,
    int nRows,
    float fZOffset = -0.4f
);

KM: Not sure if this is a visual effect only? Might be able to use for Devon to walk on water?
KM: Flood Hydros lair (Carthax lake) after freed. Probably better than swapping transition areas?

// Create a Small (4x4) Rural or City Exterior area, place the Start Location
// in the area and add this script to the area's OnEnter event. When the first
// player (or creature) enters the area the TileMagic effect will be created.
 
// This script will actually work from any object event except the module events.
 
#include "x2_inc_toollib"
 
void main()
{
    object oArea = GetArea(OBJECT_SELF);
 
    // We only want to apply tilemagic if it does not already exist.
    if (GetLocalInt(oArea, "TILEMAGIC_APPLIED") == FALSE)
    {
        // Cover a 3x3 square with knee-high water: the square starts in the
        // area's bottom left corner and extends x columns right and y rows up.
        // NOTE: the water tile has a built in z-offset of -1m, so to make it
        // it knee-high for a human (about 0.5m) we have to raise it by 1.5m.
        TLChangeAreaGroundTiles(oArea, X2_TL_GROUNDTILE_WATER, 3, 3, 1.5);
 
        // Set a variable to indicate the tilemagic exists.
        SetLocalInt(oArea, "TILEMAGIC_APPLIED", TRUE);
    }
}



Deity's
------------------
NWN (D&D) has the option to set a deity. I should set each titan as the deity for each town.
Some are specific like Berren though. Even know he is in Tenebrae most of the time, he still follows Pyros.
The titans themselves could set The Guardian as their deity though.



Creature: Titans
----------------
Use dragons as the visual interaction thing. Coloured to their element.
After "defeating" them in the Ethereal Void, I could strip them of their power and have them appear as human again.



Creatures/Characters
--------------------
The ultima wikia has lots of small rarely known details about each character.

Apparently you can set local vars directly on creatures in the toolset.
This will be good for setting some initial values like state.
Might be able to set the "bMetPC" flag there, but that won't work for multiplayer and the NPC meeting each individually.
Probably fine, but if needed that would have to be fully dynamic and concat the PC name into the var flag. eg. "bMet<FirstName>".

If setting flags and other state on a runtime created crature, then use the queued action so it safely does it after spawn is completed.
ActionDoCommand(SetLocal<T>(object oObject, string sVarName, T tValue))
ActionDoCommand(SetLocalInt(object oObject, string sVarName, int nValue))
ActionDoCommand(SetLocalString(object oObject, string sVarName, string sValue))



Tavern drunk
------------
https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=GetEnteringObject

Gets the object that last opened or entered the calling object.

object GetEnteringObject();

// Greet any Players that come into a trigger set around a drunk in a tavern.
void main()
{
    if (GetIsPC(GetEnteringObject()))
    {
        AssignCommand(GetNearestObjectByTag("TavernPatron"), SpeakOneLinerConversation("DrunkGreeting"));
        AssignCommand(GetNearestObjectByTag("TavernPatron"), ActionPlayAnimation(ANIMATION_LOOPING_PAUSE_DRUNK));
    }
}



Creature: Mythran
-----------------
http://ultima.wikia.com/wiki/Mythran
Trivia:
He gives a potion once a day. He is visited by Shaana.



Creature: Changling
-------------------
By default could use a gnome with gray clothes?
There was some function to copy a creature. That could be used to mimic its target player.



Tavern joining to the other 2 houses
------------------------------------
I don't think the rural tileset had options for houses to join for those, but what i can do
is make them join through a basement tunnel thing. Just drop in a exit low and either do the
joiner room or just port between each directly. Not sure about putting them in the same
internal area or having 3 separate areas. I don't want path finders to go through the houses
to get into the tavern, which they might do when using those common generic path finding points.
So its probalby worth doing them as 3 separate ones.



Electric Traps
--------------
https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=TrapDoElectricalDamage

Function for doing electrical traps.

void TrapDoElectricalDamage(
    int ngDamageMaster,
    int nSaveDC,
    int nSecondary
);
