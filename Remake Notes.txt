- how does key unlocking work in NWN.
  do you need to use a key at a target,
  or select an unlock option with right click menu,
  or can you just open a door if you have the key in your inventory?
  should i have a container item 'keyring'?


- fix:
  docks: trap on chest in broken tower is to strong. make it weak trap. it killed my level 4?
  docks: devons camp fire and bedroll have grass growing through. maybe drop a single road tile there.
  herdsmans valley: maybe remove lootable dirt patch near ghost cave.
  herdsmans ghost cave: should it just be called 'ghost cave'? need to check the quest/story behind it again.
  herdsmans ghost cave: probably have a hidden chest with magic armour. need good spot to find. thurgests spell could give spot buff.


- test areas:
  docks: look at chest in broken tower, and hidden chest with key. try unlock.
  fishermans reef: look at newly built area, check caves again.
  herdsmans ghost cave: look around see if it feels right. test all stairs.
  plateau entrance cave: look at newly built area. test lever to open door. i scripted it.
  plateau area: lots of stuff.. missing a trap from NW ruin in front of chest.
  plateau cave: look around see what it feels like.


- next places to build:
  + tenebrae castle (fancy interior)
  + tenebrae prison (dungeon? the dungeon under castle)
  + east tenebrae (city ext)
  + east road (rural, needs ocean side)
  + slayer cave (sea cave? call it 'treasure cove')
  + cemetary (rural, has grave objects)
  + catacombs upper (crypt. entrance from cemetary)
  + catacombs upper cave (cave. the place that leaves cats and takes you to argents, carthax, daemons...)
  + stone cove
  + catacombs shrine (not sure which tileset, birthplace of moriens and zealan shrine)
  + catacombs ancients (cave. this is upper 2 where you go for nacro quest)
  + catacombs lower (crypt)
  + pit of death (cave)
  + hall of mountain king (cave)
  + argent rock isle (forest or rural)
  + path to stratos (forest, lots of high feeling platforms and brightish fog)
  + monestary catacomb? (cave, the place below argent rock temple)
  + carthax lake (cave or sea cave? need 2 versions, dry and flooded)
  + carthax lake cave (cave) where you go to open ground and release water)
  + lava tunnel (dungeon? entrance to daemons crag [outdoor], need 2 versions for before and after hydros)
  + daemons crag (dungeon [outdoor])
  + obsidian fortress (dungon [indoor], includes master sorcorers chamber or should i seperate?)
  + ...
  + house/building interiors...


- for argentrock temple interior use nwn first temple. It has side room exits for library.
  Use hand shape altar.
  probably make path to stratos its own zone (teleported to using air walk).
  use forest tileset with lots of pits. make a light gray fog and closer fog dist like in clouds.


- daemons crag supposed to air walk jump to middle rock, then north to waterfall to jump again
  (after hydros free).


- once map layouts are done go over them to add detail props.
  Pagan had a lot of mushrooms and things.


- try some conversations, game flags and cut scene scripting.
  devon on the beach.
  docks first chop.


- can i get an ultima style font to be used for conversation? look into Hak packs and 'override'?


- see official origin ultima walkthrough for proper design and usecode file for conversations.


- there seems to be about 6 hours per day cycle in pagan (6 named time periods). see a guard log for the list of names.


- possible module names:
  + Dungeons and Pagans or DnP (a play on 'DnD')
  + Tenebrae Nights (a play on Neverwinter Nights and the pagan perpetual twilight)
  + Pagan (no ultima in the name)
  + Pagain (play on 'pagan' and 'again')
  + VIII (just 8)
