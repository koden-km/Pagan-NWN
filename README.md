Pagan-NWN
=========

An old attempt at remaking Ultima 8 Pagan with the Neverwinter Nights toolkit.

I last worked on this some time in 2010.
I only used the built in tilesets and assets that were available. I can't remember if it needed the expansion packs.
Most of the map entries/exits should be connected to walk through the world. I don't think any of the houses in towns have indoor areas yet.
I don't think i had any NPC's or mobs in there yet.

**Update March 2014**
I fixed most of the missing map area links and reset the module starting position back to the Docks.
Treasure Cove (Slayer cave) and Stratos areas are the only ones built but not linked. The scripts to get to them don't seem to work.
