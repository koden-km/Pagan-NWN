Pagan-NWN
=========

An old attempt at remaking Ultima 8 Pagan with the Neverwinter Nights toolkit.

I last worked on this some time in 2010.
I only used the built in tilesets and assets that were available. I can't remember if it needed the expansion packs.
Most of the map entries/exits should be connected to walk through the world. I don't think any of the houses in towns have indoor areas yet.
I don't think i had any NPC's or mobs in there yet.
