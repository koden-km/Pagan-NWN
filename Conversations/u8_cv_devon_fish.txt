        [PC:1] @ Who are you?
            [OWNER:2] @ I am Devon, my strange friend. And I am glad to see you are feeling better, <FirstName>.
                [PC:2 Action(u8_ca_metdevon1)] @ How do you know my name?
                    [OWNER:3] @ I am sorry, I did not mean to pry, but when I found you, I knew not who you were. I am afraid I read through your logbook and discovered your name. Please forgive me.
                        [PC:3] @ Where am I?
                            [OWNER:4 Action(TODO: make journal note? only do journal once)] @ Why, on the shore, friend, safe now and thankfully alive.
